# myTurret
An entirely autonomous turreted robot. Created as an off-season project of Team 1073, the goal was to create an entirely autonomous turret that could track a target, specified in the "Turret Challenge" Google Doc, listed below.

The "Turret Challenge" we were trying to complete can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12XUpSW2hNzF-sY8PlguTD7geNNq0UKJ0uThnmn1nRx0/edit?usp=sharing

The Raspberry Pi code required for this bot can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19V95swIB6zWV6DSlNS_E6ZsIYwNrkdReCH-DmFRnl9Q/edit?usp=sharing

You will need WPI's "wpilib" for FRC to run this code.
